## Who Is Building This

- **Chris Ragain** — Founder, CPA/PFS, Sentinel Wealth & Tax (Bonita Springs/Naples, FL)
- **Argus** — AI assistant (OpenClaw) — planning + coding
- **Nick** — Staff, primary tax workflow user
- **Viktor** — Sentinel's business AI agent, will integrate with this platform via API

---

## What We're Building

A full practice management platform to **replace TaxDome**, built on the existing DarkLion codebase. The platform is API-first — everything a human staff member can do, Viktor (the AI agent) can do via the same endpoints.

**The core insight:** TaxDome (and every competitor) bolts AI on top. We're building AI-native from the ground up.

---

## The Data Model (Foundation)

Three-level hierarchy:

```
Relationship  →  the household/group (top-level billing unit)
├── Companies →  legal entities (S-corp, LLC, 1040, Trust, etc.)
└── People    →  individuals with portal logins
    └── person_company_access (who sees which companies)
```

**Key rules:**
- Every Company belongs to one Relationship
- Every Person belongs to one Relationship
- A Person can own/access multiple Companies
- A Company can be accessed by multiple People
- Billing is at the Relationship level (Stripe)
- Portals are per-Person (spouses each have their own login, shared view)
- A Person can only move between Relationships manually (staff action or Viktor)

---

## Design Principles

1. **API-first** — UI and Viktor both call the same endpoints. No special backdoors.
2. **SOC 2 from day one** — field-level encryption, signed URLs, full audit trail, no PII in logs
3. **Nothing deleted, only added** — existing DarkLion bookkeeping features migrate into the Companies/Bookkeeping section
4. **Additive migrations** — every DB change is idempotent and non-breaking

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (Railway)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Railway)
- **File storage:** AWS S3 (signed URLs, never direct access)
- **Auth:** JWT (staff: 24h, portal clients: 7d)
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM, app-level, key in `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var
- **Email:** Resend (transactional only — notifications, no content in email body)
- **Payments:** Stripe (planned, Phase 10)
- **Existing integrations:** QuickBooks Online, Gusto

---

## Build Phases

### ✅ Phase 1 — Foundation (COMPLETE — 2026-03-20)
**What was built:**
- `server/utils/encryption.js` — AES-256-GCM field encryption (SSN, DOB, EIN)
- New DB tables: `relationships`, `people`, `person_company_access`
- New columns on `companies`: `relationship_id`, `entity_type`, `ein_encrypted`, `tax_year_end`, `stanford_tax_url`, `status`
- New columns on `firm_users`: `display_name`, expanded role to include `staff` and `agent`
- Backfill migration: every existing QBO company wrapped in a Relationship automatically
- `server/routes/relationships.js` — full CRUD + sub-routes
- `server/routes/people.js` — full CRUD + company access grant/revoke + encryption
- `GET /api/search?q=` — unified search across relationships, companies, people
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var set in Railway

---

### ✅ Phase 2 — Auth + Portal Logins (COMPLETE — 2026-03-20)
**What was built:**
- `server/middleware/requirePortal.js` — client JWT validation (type:'portal', rejects staff tokens)
- `server/routes/portal-auth.js` — portal login, invite accept, forgot/reset password, firm-info
- `server/routes/portal.js` — protected client API: `/portal/me`, `/portal/companies`, `/portal/documents`
- `public/portal-login.html` — dark-themed client login page
- `public/portal.html` — client portal placeholder (welcome + company list + logout)
- `firms.slug` column — auto-generated from firm name on startup
- Portal tokens: 7-day expiry. Clients invited via token link, set password on first login.
- Forgot password: stores reset token, email sending wired up in Phase 5

**Notes:**
- Staff tokens and portal tokens are completely separate and can't be mixed
- Portal email notifications (Resend) not yet wired — storing reset tokens but not sending yet

---

### ✅ Phase 3 — Internal CRM UI (COMPLETE — 2026-03-20)
**What was built:**
- `public/crm.html` — staff CRM page at `/crm` (1,500+ lines, fully self-contained)
- Three-tab layout: Relationships, People, Companies
- Relationship detail panel (slide-in right): people list, companies list, notes with auto-save
- Person detail panel — the **360° view**: contact info, DOB masked, SSN indicator, spouse link, StanfordTax URL button, inline notes, portal invite button, company access with grant/revoke
- Modal forms: New/Edit Relationship, New/Edit Person (all fields, searchable dropdowns)
- Unified header search across all three entity types (grouped results, click to open detail)
- Toast notifications, loading states, empty states, error messages
- Mobile-responsive sidebar
- CRM link (🗂️) added to main dashboard sidebar
- `/crm` route added to `server/index.js`

**Phase 3b additions (full-page detail views):**
- `public/crm-person.html` — `/crm/person/:id`, tabs: Overview · Docs · Tax · Communication · Organizers · Workflow · Notes · Billing
- `public/crm-company.html` — `/crm/company/:id`, tabs: Overview · Docs · Tax · Bookkeeping · Communication · Organizers · Workflow · Notes. Bookkeeping tab has secondary sub-tabs: Close Package · Uncategorized · P&L Variance · Liability Health · Payroll Check · Statements · Statement Calendar
- `public/crm-relationship.html` — `/crm/relationship/:id`, tabs: Overview · Notes · Billing
- Dashboard sidebar stripped of bookkeeping items — those live inside Company → Bookkeeping tab
- `GET /api/companies/:id` and `PUT /api/companies/:id` added
- `notes` column added to companies table
- `folder_section` and `folder_category` columns added to documents table

---

### ✅ Phase 4 — Document Management (COMPLETE — 2026-03-20)
**What was built:**
- `server/services/s3.js` — uploadFile, getSignedDownloadUrl (15-min expiry), deleteFile, key builder
- `server/routes/documents.js` — list, upload (50MB, memory storage), download (signed URL), update metadata, deliver to client, delete from S3+DB. s3_key never returned.
- `server/db.js` — documents table added (idempotent)
- `server/routes/portal.js` — `GET /portal/documents/:id/download` — verifies access, generates signed URL, marks viewed_at on first view
- `public/crm.html` — real documents tab in Person Detail Panel (Personal + By Company sub-tabs), drag-and-drop upload modal, deliver toggle, delete. Also docs tab in Relationship Detail Panel.
- `public/portal.html` — client document view grouped by year/owner, download button, viewed indicator

---

### ✅ Phase 5 — Client Portal (COMPLETE — 2026-03-20)
**What was built:**
- `server/services/email.js` — Resend email service, branded HTML templates for invite, reset, notification. Graceful degradation if key missing.
- `POST /portal-auth/send-invite` — staff sends invite → client gets email with set-password link
- `POST /portal-auth/forgot-password` — now actually sends reset email via Resend
- `GET /portal/stanford-tax` — personal + company organizer URLs
- `GET /portal/messages` + `POST /portal/messages/send` — stub, ready for Phase 8
- `POST /portal/upload` — client can upload their own documents (folder_section='client_uploaded')
- `public/portal.html` — full rebuild: Overview · Documents · Organizers · Messages tabs, company cards, year-folder doc view with NEW badge, drag-drop upload, mobile-first
- `public/portal-login.html` — now handles invite (`?invite=TOKEN`) and reset (`?reset=TOKEN`) flows
- One env var needed: `APP_URL=https://darklion.ai` (for invite/reset email links)

---

### ⏳ Phase 6 — Pipelines
**Plan:**
- DB tables: `pipeline_templates`, `pipeline_stages`, `pipeline_instances`, `pipeline_jobs`, `pipeline_job_history`
- Staff UI: Kanban board (templates + instances + jobs)
- Pipeline types: fully customizable stages, entity_type locked per template (company/person/relationship)
- Jobs manually added — no auto-population
- Viktor can read and move jobs via API
- Reference: existing TaxDome pipeline had 11 stages for business tax returns (see SCHEMA_PLAN.md)
- Bookkeeping pipeline uses 12 stages (Jan–Dec months)

---

### ⏳ Phase 7 — Tax Return Delivery + E-Signatures
**Plan:**
- Deliver a document through the portal with status tracking (delivered → viewed → signed)
- E-signature flow for 8879s and engagement letters
- Dual-signer support (joint returns — both spouses sign from their own portal)
- Audit trail: IP, timestamp, user agent per signature
- Port logic from existing proposals app

---

### ✅ Phase 8 — Secure Messaging (COMPLETE — 2026-03-20)
**What was built:**
- DB tables: `message_threads`, `thread_companies` (multi-company tagging), `messages`
- `server/routes/messages.js` — full staff API: inbox, thread detail, create, reply, status/assign, company tagging, mark read
- `server/services/claude.js` — `classifyMessage()` added — Haiku classifies message content against person's companies, non-fatal
- `server/routes/portal.js` — real portal messaging: thread list, thread detail (marks read), send message (triggers classification, flips to 'open')
- `public/messages.html` — firm inbox: split-panel, filter tabs (Active/Open/Waiting/Resolved/All), search, internal note toggle, company tag management
- `public/portal.html` — real chat UI: bubbles (client right / staff left), unread badge, Enter to send
- `public/crm-person.html` — Communication tab: live thread list + detail + reply with internal note toggle
- `public/crm-company.html` — Communication tab: company-scoped threads + person picker for new threads
- 💬 Messages link added to Work section on all sidebars

---

### ⏊ Phase 9 — Proposals + Engagement Letters *(SKIPPED — not building)*
**Plan:**
- Port existing proposals app into DarkLion
- Full flow: proposal → e-sign → auto-create client record + pipeline job
- Engagement letters with e-signature

---

### ⏊ Phase 10 — Billing *(SKIPPED — not building)*
**Plan:**
- Stripe subscriptions at Relationship level
- Monthly packages (tiered), one-time fees, payment tracking
- `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id` already on `relationships` table

---

### ⏳ Phase 11 — Viktor Full Integration
**Plan:**
- Viktor (the business AI agent) gets an `agent` role in `firm_users`
- All existing API endpoints accessible with agent JWT
- Every action logged with `role='agent'` in audit trail
- Viktor can: create/update relationships/people/companies, move pipeline jobs, send portal messages, deliver documents, request signatures
- This isn't a phase so much as a continuous thread — Viktor can use any endpoint from Phase 1 onward

---

### ⏳ Phase 12+ — Gmail Connector (Google Workspace Domain-Wide Delegation)
**Plan:**
- Use Google Workspace service account with domain-wide delegation (NOT per-user OAuth)
- One-time admin setup: Google Cloud project → Gmail API → service account JSON key → Workspace Admin domain-wide delegation with `gmail.readonly` scope
- DarkLion service account impersonates each staff mailbox to pull emails automatically — no action required from staff
- Match sender/recipient to known Person records by email address
- Create message threads on matched Person records (same thread model as portal messaging)
- Viktor monitors incoming threads, alerts if a client email to one staff member should be seen by others
- De-duplicate: same email ID never creates two threads
- Stored in existing `message_threads` + `messages` tables (sender_type = 'client', source = 'gmail')
- Staff can override Viktor's company classification

**Setup needed (one-time, ~20 min):**
1. Google Cloud Console → new project "DarkLion" → enable Gmail API
2. IAM → Service Accounts → create "darklion-gmail" → download JSON key
3. Google Workspace Admin → Security → API Controls → Domain-wide Delegation → add service account Client ID with scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
4. Add JSON key + staff email list to Railway env vars

**Why this approach:**
- Fully automatic — staff don't need to BCC or remember anything
- Works for entire Workspace domain in one setup
- No per-user OAuth, no Google verification needed for internal use

---

## Features NOT Being Built (skipped from TaxDome)
- Time tracking (flat-fee billing model, not hourly)
- Complex team permissions / multi-office management
- Built-in scheduling (using Cal.com)
- Built-in email marketing (using Resend weekly cron)

### ⏳ Phase 13 — Native AI Layer (Viktor Efficiency Infrastructure)

**Goal:** Make DarkLion smarter so Viktor spends time on judgment calls, not mechanical work.

#### Smart Triage & Pre-processing
- Auto-classify inbound messages/emails by type (tax question, document request, billing, urgent notice, general) — upgrade from basic Haiku classification to full context-aware routing
- Auto-tag messages to the correct company based on content + sender history
- Detect urgent signals: IRS notices, deadlines, "ASAP" language → escalate immediately
- De-duplicate: detect when a client emailed twice about the same issue

#### Proactive Alert Engine
DarkLion monitors the DB and fires alerts to Viktor (or staff inbox) when:
- Tax return unsigned after X days → prompt follow-up
- Pipeline job stuck in same stage for 2+ weeks
- RMD season (Jan): flag clients 73+ with no RMD pipeline job
- IRMAA lookback: flag clients with high income 2 years prior → review for Medicare surcharge
- Client portal document unviewed 30+ days after delivery
- Client hasn't logged into portal in 60+ days
- New client created but no onboarding pipeline started

#### Data Enrichment for Viktor
- **Client brief generator**: on demand or before scheduled meetings — summarizes open pipelines, recent messages, unreviewed documents, upcoming deadlines for a given client
- **Status summary**: when Viktor asks "what's open for the Ragain Family?" → DarkLion compiles full picture across all entities
- **Document auto-classification**: when client uploads a document, Claude infers the type (W-2, 1099, bank statement, etc.) and suggests the correct folder

#### Workflow Automation (no Viktor needed)
- Tax return fully signed by all signers → auto-advance pipeline to "Delivered" stage
- New client (Person or Company) created → auto-generate standard onboarding pipeline from template
- Client uploads a document → auto-classify into correct year/category folder
- Message thread idle for 7 days with no staff reply → flag to staff inbox

#### Implementation Notes
- Alert engine runs as a cron job (2 AM UTC, same as nightly scans)
- Alerts stored in a new `ai_alerts` table: `{ firm_id, type, entity_type, entity_id, message, severity, resolved_at }`
- Staff dashboard shows active alerts; Viktor can resolve or act on them
- All automation is auditable — logged in the existing audit trail
